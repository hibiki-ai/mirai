Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 1.1.1.9003
Description: Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression
    asynchronously in a parallel process, on the local machine or distributed
    over the network, with the result automatically available upon completion.
    Modern networking and concurrency built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg
    Next Gen) ensures reliable and efficient scheduling, over fast inter-process
    communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS. Advantages include being inherently
    queued, allowing the sending of many more tasks than available processes, no
    arbitrary connection limits, no storage on the file system, support for
    otherwise non-exportable reference objects, an event-driven 'promises'
    implementation, and very low overhead. Incorporates asynchronous parallel
    map functionality.
