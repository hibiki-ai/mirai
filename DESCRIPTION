Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 1.1.1.9001
Description: High-performance parallel code execution and distributed computing.
    Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously
    in a separate process, on the local machine or over the network, returning
    the result automatically upon completion. Modern networking and concurrency
    built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) ensures reliable and
    efficient scheduling, over fast inter-process communications or TCP/IP
    secured by TLS. Advantages include being inherently queued, allowing the
    sending of many more tasks than available connections, no arbitrary
    connection limits, no storage on the filesystem, support for otherwise
    non-exportable reference objects, an event-driven 'promises' implementation,
    and very low overhead. A parallel map function is included.
